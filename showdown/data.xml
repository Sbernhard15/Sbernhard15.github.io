  <description>A 1-4 player co-op/competitive board game, Showdown follows 4 characters: the Lawman, the Cowboy, the Outlaw, and the Tycoon. Each player starts off on the same side of the map entrance and must work their way to the endpoint, where a final boss awaits. As players march across the map, they can choose to cooperate in order to more easily reach the end, filling beasts with lead, or they can choose to play against each other and use item cards or steal kills and loot to impede other players’ progress. While moving through the dungeon, players will flip enemy tiles, random encounters of sorts that challenge players’ combat and offer item cards as loot. The game is a dungeon crawl, as players must reach the final area and engage the final boss enemy to escape alive. Combat revolves around character traits and dice-based combat. Depending on the type of weapon in use for each individual player, attacks are made with multiple dice rolls, and then corresponding dodge dice rolls are made. After running out of ammo, players must use an action to reload, and depending on the dice roll, the reload can be entirely successful or only reload one bullet. Players have two action points for movement and attack. While in combat, players attack twice, though reloading takes an action point every time it’s used. Special abilities also use an action point, as do using item cards.
